# Brahim SADIK Portfolio


Created this branch to integrate auth and database to store all the information.

The login will be a private thing only accessible to the author of the code.

The authentication will give access to a database where we will store all the information displayed on the site, might even help with dynamic pages.

We will use Clerk with NeonDB (free tier) to achieve this.

(Comming soon once figuring out all the requirements)
